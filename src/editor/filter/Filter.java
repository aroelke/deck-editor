/**
 * This class represents a filter to group a collection of Cards by various characteristics.
 * Each filter has a String representation and can parse a String for its values.  The overall
 * filter is represented by a tree whose internal nodes are groups and whose leaf nodes filter
 * out characteristics.  A filter can test if a Card matches its characteristics.
 * <p>
 * Note that because filters are mutable, they do not make good keys or Set
 * members.
